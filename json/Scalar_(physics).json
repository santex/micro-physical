{"cursor":"5409","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn physics, a 'scalar' is a physical quantity that is unchanged by coordinate\nsystem rotations or translations (in Newtonian mechanics), or by Lorentz\ntransformations or space-time translations (in relativity).\n\nA scalar is a quantity which can be described by a single number, unlike\nvectors, tensors, etc. which are described by several numbers which describe\nmagnitude and direction. A related concept is a pseudoscalar, which is invariant\nunder proper rotations but (like a pseudovector) flips sign under improper\nrotations. The concept of a scalar in physics is essentially the same as in\nmathematics.\n\nAn example of a scalar quantity is temperature: the temperature at a given point\nis a single number. Velocity, on the other hand, is a vector quantity: velocity\nin three-dimensional space is specified by three values; in a Cartesian\ncoordinate system the values are the speeds relative to each coordinate axis.\n","linknr":169,"url":"Scalar_(physics)","recorded":1362480443,"links":26,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","physics","mathematics","mathematics","physics","geometric"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Concepts in physics"],"headings":["Physical quantity","Examples in classical physics","Scalars in relativity theory","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["pseudoscalar","physics"],["scalar","mathematics"],["product","mathematics"],["metric","mathematics"],["charge","physics"],["direction","geometry,_geography"],["magnitude","mathematics"],["vector","geometric"]],"members":["magnitude","direction","scalar","charge","metric","product","pseudoscalar","vector"],"related":["Physics","Physical_quantity","Coordinate_system","Lorentz_transformation","Euclidean_vector","Tensor","Pseudoscalar_(physics)","Proper_rotation","Pseudovector","Improper_rotation","Scalar_(mathematics)","Temperature","Cartesian_coordinate_system","Coordinate_axis","Quantity","Product_(mathematics)","Number","Physical_unit","Orthonormal","Metric_(mathematics)","Mass","Charge_(physics)","Volume","Time_in_physics","Speed","Temperature","Electric_potential","Distance","Direction_(geometry,_geography)","Force","Magnitude_(mathematics)","Gravitation","Force","Speed","Velocity","Electric_charge","Charge_density","Triple_product","Vector_(geometric)","Magnetic_charge","Theory_of_relativity","Classical_physics","Charge_density","Current_density","Energy_density","Pressure","Stress-energy_tensor","Electric_charge","Proper_time","Proper_length","Invariant_mass","Scalar_field","Scalar_field_theory","Relative_scalar","Academic_Press","The_Feynman_Lectures_on_Physics"]}
