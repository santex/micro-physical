{"cursor":"4371","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn physics, 'intensity' is the power transferred per unit area. In the SI\nsystem, it has units watts per metre squared (W/m 2). It is used most\nfrequently with waves (e.g. sound or light), in which case the ''average'' power\ntransfer over one period of the wave is used. Intensity can be applied to other\ncircumstances where energy is transferred. For example, one could calculate the\nintensity of the kinetic energy carried by drops of water from a garden\nsprinkler.\n\nThe word \"intensity\" as used here is not synonymous with \"\", \"\", or \"\", as it\nsometimes is in colloquial speech.\n\nIntensity can be found by taking the energy density (energy per unit volume) at\na point in space and multiplying it by the velocity at which the energy is\nmoving. The resulting vector has the units of power divided by area.\n","linknr":288,"url":"Intensity_(physics)","recorded":1362556917,"links":27,"instances":["astronomy","physics","optics","physics","geometry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Optics","Radiometry","Physical quantities"],"headings":["Mathematical description","Alternative definitions of \"intensity\"","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/b/e/bbe292a285490910ed7a015c4a4a66d7.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/5/0/0505831a41059ecc2dbe8e78924c4366.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/8/a/f8aa962808ab12cfbf75213b2c9b735d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/5/2/2525205167b2a8f4b1e589a519d56ccd.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/d/e/cdebee4db2c40ae301a3b855714d9716.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/c/9/dc93a0c5ed672fbf1037df2d65a34952.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/1/d/b1d151e49318585c1c2acbd947545bd6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/a/8/4a8a08f09d37b73795649038408b5f33.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/2/2/c224f6cb978d975f587c4a2f9e1db179.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["power","physics"],["period","physics"],["vector","geometry"],["power","physics"],["photometry","optics"],["magnitude","astronomy"]],"members":["magnitude","period","photometry","power","vector"],"related":["Physics","Power_(physics)","Area","SI","Wave","Sound","Light","Time_averaging","Period_(physics)","Kinetic_energy","Garden_sprinkler","Energy_density","Velocity","Vector_(geometry)","Power_(physics)","Area","Point_source","Inverse-square_law","Conservation_of_energy","Differential_element","Electromagnetic_wave","Complex_number","Amplitude","Electric_field","Energy_density","Refractive_index","Speed_of_light","Vacuum","Vacuum_permittivity","Evanescent_wave","Poynting_vector","Photometry_(optics)","Radiometry","Optics","Radiant_intensity","Luminous_intensity","Irradiance","Radiance","Heat_transfer","Sound_intensity","Magnitude_(astronomy)"]}
