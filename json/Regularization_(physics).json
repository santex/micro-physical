The correct physical result is obtained in\nthe limit in which the regulator goes away (in our example, \\epsilon\\to\n0 ), but the virtue of the regulator is that for its finite value, the\nresult is finite.\n\nHowever, the result usually includes terms proportional to expressions like\n1/ \\epsilon which are not well-defined in the limit\n\\epsilon\\to 0 . Regularization is the first step towards obtaining a\ncompletely finite and meaningful result; in quantum field theory it must be\nusually followed by a related, but independent technique called renormalization.\nRenormalization is based on the requirement that some physical quantities\n— expressed by seemingly divergent expressions such as 1/\n\\epsilon — are equal to the observed values. Such a constraint\nallows one to calculate a finite value for many other quantities that looked\ndivergent.\n\nThe existence of a limit as Îµ goes to zero and the independence of the final\nresult from the regulator are nontrivial facts. The underlying reason for them\nlies in universality as shown by Kenneth Wilson and Leo Kadanoff and the\nexistence of a second order phase transition. Sometimes, taking the limit as Îµ\ngoes to zero is not possible. This is the case when we have a Landau pole and\nfor nonrenormalizable couplings like the Fermi interaction. However, even for\nthese two examples, if the regulator only gives reasonable results for\n\\epsilon \\gg 1/\\Lambda and we are working with scales of the order\nof 1/\\Lambda' , regulators with 1/\\Lambda \\ll \\epsilon \\ll\n1/\\Lambda' still give pretty accurate approximations. The physical\nreason why we can't take the limit of Îµ going to zero is the existence of new\nphysics below Î.\n\nIt is not always possible to define a regularization such that the limit of Îµ\ngoing to zero is independent of the regularization. In this case, one says that\nthe theory contains an anomaly. Anomalous theories have been studied in great\ndetail and are often founded on the celebrated AtiyahâSinger index theorem or\nvariations thereof (see, for example, the chiral anomaly).\n\nSpecific types of regularization include *Dimensional regularization 't\nHooft, Veltman M.: Regularization and renormalization of gauge fields, Nucl.\nPhys.
