{"cursor":"6476","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nQuantization}}\n\n\n\nIn physics, 'quantization' is the process of explaining a classical\nunderstanding of physical phenomena in terms of a newer understanding known as\n\"quantum mechanics\". It is a procedure for constructing a quantum field theory\nstarting from a classical field theory. This is a generalization of the\nprocedure for building quantum mechanics from classical mechanics. One also\nspeaks of 'field quantization', as in the \"quantization of the electromagnetic\nfield\", where one refers to photons as field \"quanta\" (for instance as light\nquanta). This procedure is basic to theories of particle physics, nuclear\nphysics, condensed matter physics, and quantum optics.\n\nThe fundamental notion that a physical property may be \"quantized,\" is referred\nto as \"the hypothesis of quantization\". This means that the magnitude can take\non only certain discrete values.\n","linknr":297,"url":"Quantization_(physics)","recorded":1362892168,"links":37,"instances":["physics","quantum_mechanics","physics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Concepts in physics","Theoretical physics","Quantum mechanics","Quantum field theory","Mathematical quantization","Mathematical physics"],"headings":["Quantization methods","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Feynmann_Diagram_Gluon_Radiation.svg/211px-Feynmann_Diagram_Gluon_Radiation.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/d/f/9dfd055ef1683b053f1b5bf9ed6dbbb4.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["field","physics"],["field","physics"],["field","physics"],["field","physics"],["hamiltonian","quantum_mechanics"],["action","physics"]],"members":["action","hamiltonian","field"],"related":["Physics","Quantum_mechanics","Quantum_field_theory","Field_(physics)","Quantum_mechanics","Classical_mechanics","Electromagnetic_field","Photons","Quantum_","Light_quantum","Particle_physics","Nuclear_physics","Condensed_matter_physics","Quantum_optics","Field_(physics)","Quantum_states","Vacuum_state","Quantum_amplitude","Renormalization","Canonical_quantization","Canonical_quantization","Quantum_mechanics","Classical_mechanics","Field_(physics)","Canonical_coordinate","Canonical_momentum","Commutation_relation","Quantum_mechanics","Creation_and_annihilation_operators","Field_operator","Quantum_state","Vacuum_state","Second_quantization","Field_(physics)","Fermion","Boson","Internal_symmetry","Vacuum_state","Quantum_field_theory","Quantum_chromodynamics","QCD_vacuum","Vacuum_expectation_value","Hamiltonian_(quantum_mechanics)","Analysis_of_flows","Eulerâ€“Lagrange_equation","Peierls_bracket","Analysis_of_flows","Batalin-Vilkovisky_formalism","BRST_formalism","Phase_space_formulation","Moyal_bracket","Moyal_product","Wigner_quasi-probability_distribution","Geometric_quantization","Loop_quantum_gravity","Action_(physics)","Variation","Path_integral_formulation","Uncertainty_principle","Schwinger's_quantum_action_principle","First_quantization","Feynman_path_integral","Photon_polarization","Quantum_Hall_effect","Quantum_number"]}
