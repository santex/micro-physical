{"cursor":"2795","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n'Deposition', also known as 'desublimation', is a thermodynamic process, a phase\ntransition in which gas transforms into solid. The reverse of deposition is\nsublimation.\n\nOne example of deposition is the process by which, in sub-freezing air, water\nvapor changes directly to ice without first becoming a liquid. This is how snow\nforms in clouds, as well as frost and hoar frost on the ground. Another example\nis when frost forms on a leaf. For deposition to occur, thermal energy must be\nremoved from a gas. When the leaf becomes cold enough, water vapor in the air\nsurrounding the leaf loses enough thermal energy to change into a solid.\nDeposition in water vapor occurs due to the pureness of the water vapor. The\nvapor has no foreign particles, and is therefore able to lose large amounts of\nenergy before forming around something. When the leaf is introduced, the\nsupercooled water vapor immediately begins to condensate, but by this point is\nalready past the freezing point. This causes the water vapor to change directly\ninto a solid.\n\nAnother example of physical deposition is the artificial process of physical\nvapor deposition, used to deposit thin films of various materials onto\nvarious surfaces.\n\nDeposition releases energy and is an exothermic phase change.\n","linknr":185,"url":"Deposition_(physics)","recorded":1362579736,"links":32,"instances":["chemistry","science"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Phase transitions"],"headings":["Sublimation in manufacturing","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Frost_patterns_4.jpg/300px-Frost_patterns_4.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg/40px-Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Phase_change_-_en.svg/300px-Phase_change_-_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["sublimation","chemistry"],["process","science"]],"members":["sublimation","process"],"related":["Thermodynamic_process","Phase_transition","Gas","Solid","Sublimation_(chemistry)","Process_(science)","Sub-freezing","Air","Water_vapor","Ice","Liquid","Cloud","Frost","Hoar_frost","Physical_vapor_deposition","Thin_films","Exothermic","Physical_vapor_deposition","Silicon_dioxide","Chemical_vapor_deposition","Abound_Solar","Sublimation"]}
