{"cursor":"6774","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn physics, the terms 'order' and 'disorder' designate the presence or absence\nof some symmetry or correlation in a many-particle system.\n\nIn condensed matter physics, systems typically are ordered at low temperatures;\nupon heating, they undergo one or several phase transitions into less ordered\nstates. Examples for such an 'order-disorder transition' are:\n* the melting of ice: solid-liquid transition, loss of crystalline order;\n* the demagnetization of iron by heating above the Curie temperature: ferromagnetic-\n  paramagnetic transition, loss of magnetic order.\n\nThe degree of freedom that is ordered or disordered can be translational\n(crystalline ordering), rotational (ferroelectric ordering), or a spin state\n(magnetic ordering).\n\nThe order can consist either in a full crystalline space group symmetry, or in a\ncorrelation. Depending on how the correlations decay with distance, one speaks\nof 'long-range order' or 'short-range order'.\n\nIf a disordered state is not in thermodynamic equilibrium, one speaks of\n'quenched disorder'. For instance, a glass is obtained by quenching\n(supercooling) a liquid. By extension, other quenched states are called spin\nglass, orientational glass. In some contexts, the opposite of quenched disorder\nis 'annealed disorder'.\n","linknr":159,"url":"Order_and_disorder_(physics)","recorded":1362669443,"links":20,"instances":["physics","physics","order_and_disorder","physics_and_chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Statistical mechanics","Crystallography"],"headings":["Characterising order","Quenched disorder","Annealed disorder","See also","Further reading"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/8/9/4895549cd9e0b167c88065068da49d42.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/9/8/198ebfdfc4ff058b808659fa1ec2ccce.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/0/b/60b4418b68ee26de572d0d4a0f7442c2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/0/b/60b4418b68ee26de572d0d4a0f7442c2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/0/b/60b4418b68ee26de572d0d4a0f7442c2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/57/Ordering.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["spin","physics"],["entropy","order_and_disorder"],["spin","physics"],["degrees_of_freedom","physics_and_chemistry"],["superstructure","physics"]],"members":["spin","superstructure","entropy","degrees_of_freedom"],"related":["Physics","Symmetry","Correlation","Condensed_matter_physics","Phase_transition","Curie_temperature","Crystal","Ferroelectricity","Magnetism","Space_group","Thermodynamic_equilibrium","Glass","Spin_glass","Orientational_glass","Unit_cell","Tiling","Crystal","Bravais_lattice","Space_group","Quasicrystal","Charge_ordering","Spin_(physics)","Magnetic_ordering","Neutron_diffraction","Thermodynamic","Entropy_(order_and_disorder)","Phase_transition","System","Correlation","Correlation_function","Spin_(physics)","Exponential_decay","Kosterlitz-Thouless_transition","Statistical_physics","Quenching","Spin_glass","Annealed_disorder","Replica_trick","Cavity_method","Generating_functional_analysis","Random_variable","Degrees_of_freedom_(physics_and_chemistry)","Thermal_average","Chiral_condensate","Quantum_chromodynamics","Superselection","Entropy","Topological_order","Impurity","Superstructure_(physics)"]}
